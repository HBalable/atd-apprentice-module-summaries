Unit 7: SOFTWARE DESIGN (& DEVELOPMENT)
=============
<!--
The software design process and the importance of design before development
How workflow diagrams, prototyping and presenting to intended users can aid in designing better solutions

Software Design is the process of creating a detailed schematic of a piece of software, that meets the requirements of given a brief. This could be a for building upon a piece of existing software, or 

Choosing a Language
---------------

If a new piece of software is being designed, there are many different programming languages that you could decide to build it with, each offering different advantages. A good rule of thumb is that the lower the level of language used (The less abstract languages), the more efficient your software can be. For examples you could probably write a relatively fast program in C. But using a higher level language such as C++, Pascal, or Java might mean that the software will be finished faster, as they tend to be faster to write in. Interpreted scripting languages such as Python may also be an option, as the development and support work can happen quickly. Speed and fluidity is not always the number one concern.
