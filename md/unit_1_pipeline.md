# PIPELINE

The pipeline is a term used to describe a system, made up of many different steps, for producing VFX. They have to be able to be non-linear & versatile and may differ a lot between VFX houses, depending on many different factors, not limited to:

- The size of the company.
- The talent in the company.
- The type of work expected. (e.g. Feature films, TV, Adverts..)

A typical VFX pipeline:

Collaboration between artists all working with different software packages and file formats introduces the need for a new area in companies large enough to afford them: the pipeline department. They are responsible for creating and managing custom infrastructures that aim to make interactions between different departments more efficient. With companies such as Double Negative and Cinesite branching into the world of feature animation, new and adventurous routes are being explored, with the ultimate goal of having the most cost-effective (efficient) and functional pipeline.

I explore the functions of all of the major creative departments you might find in a VFX house in Unit 10 (VFX Craft). So instead, here is a brief summary of what they each might output.

|Discipline             |Output                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
|Onset                  |Reference photos, HDRIs, LIDAR/3D scans|
|Concept                |2D & 3D art                            |
|Modelling              |3D models                              |
|Rigging                |Deformable character rigs              |
|Texture & Shader Design|Texture maps, Shader scripts           |
|Environments/DMP       |3D geometry, Matte paintings           |
|Matchmove              |3D Cameras, Animation curves           |
|Animation              |Animation curves, Geometry caches      |
|Creature               |Geometry caches                        |
|FX                     |Geometry caches                        |
|Lighting               |Light rigs, 2D passes                  |
|Roto / Prep            |2D elements                            |

The Pipeline TD's Role
-------------
Aside from the example above, a Pipeline TD also has many other responsibilities. I will explain a few below.

*Note: By "Pipeline TD", I am making a generalisation and referring to members of the pipeline department, whose titles probably differ.*

### Artist Workflow Tools
There may be some very specific tools that a show requires, or some general workflow tools that an application of choice doesn't do so well, that pipeline may be asked to develop. 

### Production Workflow Tools
In some cases, production may ask pipeline for specific tools to more easily meet their demands. 

### Meeting Production Demands
As in any business role, when faced with an issue, Pipeline TDs have to find a balance between the practical solution and the idyllic one. There can pressure to complete a script, or push some renders through as soon as possible. The TD needs to have a good enough understanding of the production, creative, & technical processes at the company to realise the consequences of their actions, which they would use to inform their decisions.
