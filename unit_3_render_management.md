<!-- 
Grid computing and its use within VFX render queues - at a basic level
How to balance resource needs within the companyâ€™s physical capacity
Render optimisation techniques -->

Rendering high detail, photorealistic images and simulations calls for a lot of computer processing power. VFX houses need to be able to produce these results quickly. To do this, they often have their own in house super-computers, called render farms, which utilize the power of grid computing.

What is Grid Computing?
--------------



Render management

Allocates farm jobs to nodes
Organises by priority
Integrated with engines and applications
Stores render stats
Possibly easier to debug > shows stack traces
Master connects to slaves using tcp/ip
Files stored on nas
Vocab:
Cluster: multiple machines sharing resources
Batch script: script
tcp/ip: transmission control protocol/ internet protocol
SOAP: used for transmitting xml files.
