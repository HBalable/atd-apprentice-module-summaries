Unit 2: DATA MANAGEMENT
=============

<!-- The importance of and techniques for managing large scale on-line and near-line data storage.
Digital images and manipulation techniques. -->

Whether for streaming lossless 4k 32-bit EXRs or reading 500 gigabyte alembic caches, VFX studios require special and expensive infrastructure to enable working efficiently with such large amounts of data. They need to ensure that there is plenty of disk space for data, that there are reliable snapshot backup and archiving systems, that it is all accessible via a speedy network and that it is all protected by a hefty firewall.

Types of Storage
-------------

### Online

This is data that is available to access instantaneously, over a network.

### Nearline

Nearline storage is an intermediate between "online" and "offline" storage. It includes any data that is only online and available to access on request. It is much more power & cost efficient for data to be nearline than online if it is not in constant use, as any disks that aren't currently in use don't have to be constantly spinning. A potential use might be in short-term backups.

### Offline

Offline storage is any data not accessible from a network. This includes any storage on removable media (i.e. USB flash drives, optical discs..) that is not currently connected or mounted on a computer, and that would require some type of intervention to be available. Old or no longer immediately useful data is often archived and taken offline, as explained in the next section.
