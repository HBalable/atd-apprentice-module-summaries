Basic Algebra
-------------
Under this very broad subheading, I will give some examples of how to rearrange mathematical statements, that you can use to simplify expressions and solve equations for unknowns.

#### Simplifying

We can collect like terms in equations to make them simpler to express.

$$4x+2y-8x+y$$

Here, 2 terms, $4x$ and $-8x$, are a product of $x$. Together they are equal to $(4-8)x=-4x$. If we do the same for the y terms and take the sum the result we get a totally simplified expression, $3y-4x$.

$$\frac{4x}{y}+\frac{3x}{2}-\frac{2y}{2}+2x$$

Here we can have 3 factor that we cannot simplify, $x$, $y$ and $x/y$. Using the same method as above, we take the 2 $x$ terms and substitute them for their the sum of the two. 

$$\frac{3x}{2}+2x=\frac{3x}{2}+\frac{4x}{2}=\frac{7x}{2}$$

Now to simplify $2y/2$:

$$\frac{2y}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times y=1 \times y = y$$

So, the simplified expression:

$$\frac{4x}{y}+\frac{7x}{2}-y$$

#### Rearranging Equations

An equations is a statement in which two mathematical expressions are equal to each other. There is really just one rule that, so long as it is followed, makes rearranging equations simple.

>You can perform mathematical operations on each "side" of the equation, so long as you perform equal operations to all sides.

Let's start with this example:

$$x+\sqrt{4y}=5+x$$

Here, if we wanted to solve for $y$, we could subtract $x$ from each side and we are left with $\sqrt{4y}=5$. Next, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by taking a square of both sides. This involves multiplying both sides of the equation with an equal expression, so it still very much follows our one rule. After simplifying $\sqrt{4y}^2=5^2$, we have $4y=25$. Lastly, we can divide all sides by 4, which would leave us with $y=25/4=6.25$.

This was a simple example but the same methodology is used when solving more complex equations such as polynomials. However, unknowns in many equations can not be described by a single value, and instead are be described as an expression which describe a range of possible values. You can craft equations with these which define shapes and curves.

Trigonometry
-------------
Trigonometry encompasses the studies of ratios including side lengths and angles of triangles. I will cover how to solve a triangle side or angle using trigonometry.

There is two trig equations we will be using: the Sine rule and Pythagorus's equation.

##### Pythagoras

Pythagoras' theorem states that, with a triangle with sides labeled $a$, $b$ and $c$, where $c$ is that triangles hypotenuse:

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

We can use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the length of a side of a triangle if we have the lengths of the 2 other sides. Let's try it in practice:

> I have a triangle whose opposite side is 13cm,  whose hypotenuse is 21cm  and whose adjacent side is $x$cm. Calculate $x$.

So we can substitute 13cm and 21cm for $a$ ($b$ would be equally as valid) and $c$ respectively. We now have:

$$13^2\mathrm{cm}+b^2=21^2\mathrm{cm}$$

If we subtract $13^2\mathrm{cm}$, we get $b^2=21^2\mathrm{cm}-13^2\mathrm{cm}$. Next step is to take the square root of each side, and evaluate:

$$b=\sqrt{21^2\mathrm{cm}-13^2\mathrm{cm}}=16.492$$

##### The Sine Rule

$$\frac{sin(A)}{a}=\frac{sin(B)}{b}=\frac{sin(C)}{c}$$

We can use rule to calculate lengths and angles of any triangle.
($a$, $A$), ($b$, $B$) and ($c$, $C$) refer to length and angle pairs opposite each other, as displayed in the diagram above in this section.
