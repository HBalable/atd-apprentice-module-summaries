Unit 6: MATHS
=============

Basic Algebra
-------------
Under this very broad subheading, I will give some examples of how to rearrange mathematical statements, that you can use to simplify expressions and solve equations for unknowns.

#### Simplifying

We can collect like terms in equations to make them simpler to express.

$$4x+2y-8x+y$$

Here, 2 terms, $4x$ and $-8x$, are a product of $x$. Together they are equal to $(4-8)x=-4x$. If we do the same for the y terms and take the sum the result we get a totally simplified expression, $3y-4x$.

$$\frac{4x}{y}+\frac{3x}{2}-\frac{2y}{2}+2x$$

Here we can have 3 factor that we cannot simplify, $x$, $y$ and $x/y$. Using the same method as above, we take the 2 $x$ terms and substitute them for their the sum of the two. 

$$\frac{3x}{2}+2x=\frac{3x}{2}+\frac{4x}{2}=\frac{7x}{2}$$

Now to simplify $2y/2$:

$$\frac{2y}{2}=\frac{2}{2}\times y=1 \times y = y$$

So, the simplified expression:

$$\frac{4x}{y}+\frac{7x}{2}-y$$

Trigonometry
-------------
Trigonometry encompasses the studies of ratios including side lengths and angles of triangles. I will cover how to solve a triangle side or angle using trigonometry.

There is two trig equations we will be using: the Sine rule and Pythagorus's equation.

##### The Sine Rule

$$\frac{sin(A)}{a}=\frac{sin(B)}{b}=\frac{sin(C)}{c}$$

##### Pythagorus

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

Matrices

$$\begin{pmatrix}4&2\\3&5\end{pmatrix}\times\begin{pmatrix}2&6\\1&8\end{pmatrix}$$
