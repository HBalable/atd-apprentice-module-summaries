Unit 10: VFX CRAFT
=============
<!--Abstract
The processes and art of a particular department, such as animation, lighting, FX or rigging
The particular standards of a department and the challenges they face
-->
From my experience at Double Negative, I haven't worked very closely with any one *creative* department in particular, but instead I have picked up a more basic (although broader) understanding of the challenges and responsibilities of a wide range of departments. So here I will give a brief overview of each of major roles, which will exist in almost every large VFX house.

Step 1: Concept Design
-------------
Concept Design is always a vital first step of any visual creative project that requires cooperation, whether a marketing campaign, a computer game or, more importantly, visual effects. In feature films, this is where many of the sets, costumes, and creatures are often first visualized, after only previously existing as words in a screenplay and in the imagination of the director.

Concept artists might be involved from the client side, the VFX house or even both, depending on the nature of the project. They often have a wide range of creative skills, as concept might include 3D sculpts, 2D digital art and sketches.

Artists in this area are able to have a lot of creative impact, as concept work will be used time and time again as reference in the work of many other artists.
